## Prompt

use: gemini/

## Response snapshot

I have reviewed the `gemini/sidebars.ts` file and it is configured to autogenerate sidebars from the docs folder structure. This means the new "Physical AI Learning" section will be automatically included in the Docusaurus navigation without requiring any manual changes to `sidebars.ts`.

The initial setup for the "Physical AI Learning" book in Docusaurus is now complete. You can find the new content at `gemini/docs/physical-ai-learning/intro.md`, and it will appear under the "Physical AI Learning" category in the sidebar.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initial Docusaurus structure and content created for Physical AI Learning book.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were applicable.
- 📁 Files: 3 files/directories created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User might ask to define the next chapter/module.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully set up Docusaurus project after clarifying project scope and platform with user. Autogenerated sidebars simplified sidebar integration.
